# Bank Account Simulation - Python OOP

This is my first Object-Oriented Programming project in Python.  
It simulates basic bank account operations like deposit, withdrawal, and balance display using classes, methods, and instance attributes.

- Create a bank account with an account holder name and initial balance.
- Deposit money into the account.
- Withdraw money from the account (with insufficient funds check).
- Display the current account balance.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

The account holder name: Tonny
Current balance: 1000
You have deposited: 255
You have withdrawn: 500
Balance: 755
