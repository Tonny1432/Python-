Python Encapsulation Example
Overview

This project demonstrates encapsulation in Python using class encapsulation.
Encapsulation is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that hides internal details of a class and restricts direct access to its attributes.

This example covers:

Public attributes → Can be accessed anywhere.

Protected attributes → Accessible, but by convention should only be used inside the class or subclasses.

Private attributes → Cannot be accessed directly outside the class; can only be accessed via getter/setter methods.
