Pattern Exploration â€“ Recursive Growth

This project explores a unique recursive sequence that starts with 1, 2, 3 and then doubles the sum of the last two values, creating a fast-growing pattern:

1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, ...

 Features
- Generates the sequence in Python.  
- Visualizes it as:
  - ðŸ“ˆ A line chart (growth over steps).  
  - ðŸŒ€ A spiral plot (nature-inspired representation).
  -
  Inspiration
The pattern shows **recursive doubling**, similar to how shells, spirals, and natural growth patterns repeat and scale.

How to Run
```bash
python pattern.py
