 Custom Python Encryption Tool 🔐

This is a custom-built encryption script in Python that uses the position of each letter in the alphabet and multiplies it by the length of a user-provided keyword.

🚀 How It Works

- Letters are converted to numbers (a=0 to z=25).
- Each number is multiplied by the length of the keyword.
- The resulting number is broken into tens and units.
- The sum of those digits determines the encrypted letter.
- Non-letter characters (like spaces) are preserved.

💬 Example

Input:my name is tonny marcus ferguson
Key: cobra
Output:gm lagc ej ohllm ganbkj hcndkjhl
