# 📊 Student Performance Analyzer using NumPy & OOPS

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a **Python-based Student Performance Analyzer** built using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)** and **NumPy**.
The goal of this project is to dynamically generate student marks, analyze their performance using NumPy operations, and generate a structured report.

This project was created as a **hands-on learning exercise** to strengthen my understanding of:

* NumPy arrays and operations
* OOPS concepts in Python
* Data analysis logic without relying on loops

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

### 🔹 Python OOPS

* Class and Object
* Constructor (`__init__`)
* Instance variables
* Encapsulation (private attributes)
* Method-based design

### 🔹 NumPy

* `np.random.randint`
* Array `shape` and `ndim`
* `sum`, `average`, `max`, `min`
* Axis-based operations
* `np.where` for classification

---

## ⚙️ Features of the Project

* Accepts **dynamic input** for:

  * Number of students
  * Number of subjects
* Automatically generates **random marks (0–100)**
* Calculates:

  * Total marks per student
  * Average marks per student
  * Highest and lowest scores
* Classifies student performance into:

  * **Excellent**
  * **Average**
  * **Poor**
* Displays a **complete student performance report**

---

## 🏗️ Project Flow

1. User enters student details (name, ID, age, department)
2. User specifies number of subjects
3. Marks are generated using NumPy
4. Statistical analysis is performed using NumPy operations
5. Students are categorized based on performance
6. Final report is displayed

---

## 🚫 Design Constraints Followed

* No hardcoded values
* No loops for numerical calculations
* NumPy used instead of Python lists for analysis
* Marks stored as a **private NumPy array**

---

## 📈 Sample Output Includes

* Student details
* Marks matrix
* Total and average marks
* Performance category for each student

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcome

Through this project, I learned how to:

* Think in terms of **arrays instead of individual variables**
* Apply **NumPy vectorized operations**
* Design a small but complete **data analysis workflow**
* Combine **OOPS structure with numerical computing**

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Store data using CSV or Excel files
* Add data visualization using Matplotlib
* Separate logic into multiple classes
* Improve encapsulation of student metadata

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **NumPy**

---

## 📌 Note

This project is intended for **learning and practice purposes** and reflects my personal approach to applying NumPy and OOPS concepts together.
